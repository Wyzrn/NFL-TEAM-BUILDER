<h1>About the NFL Team Builder</h1>
<hr />
<p class="page-content">
  NFL Team Builder is a web application designed for football fans who want to create and manage their own custom NFL teams. Instead of focusing on collecting individual players, this app allows users to build entire teams, experiment with different lineups, and organize rosters based on their preferences. The goal is to provide an interactive and engaging platform where users can explore team-building strategies, try out various combinations, and see how their dream teams might look on paper.<br><br>
  Whether you are a dedicated football enthusiast, a fantasy football player, or someone who enjoys exploring the dynamics of team management, NFL Team Builder offers a user-friendly experience. You can add, edit, and remove teams, customize team details, and keep track of your creations all in one place. The app is built with modern web technologies and features a clean, accessible design with a forest green theme to reflect the spirit of the game.<br><br>
  This project was created as part of a software engineering course to demonstrate full-stack development skills, including database integration, authentication, and responsive design. I am passionate about both football and technology, and I hope this app brings a bit of both worlds together for users to enjoy. If you have feedback or ideas for new features, feel free to reach out. Thank you for visiting, and happy team building!
